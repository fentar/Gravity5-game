#  Gravity 5

Gravity 5 was a project of mine while experimenting with 3D games. It was developed with Unity.

I have always been fascinated by video games and how they are made. 
So I decided to take on a small project in my free time and I created this fun game.

The main point if of course *gravity*, I was so amazed by the physics engine. Things falling from the sky is honestly my type. 

It's definitely far from perfect, but I had so much fun making it and trying to think about new levels, new graphics, enhancements etc that for me it's worth to display in my profile. All the knowledge required to build it, I learned from the internet, YouTube tutorials and of course StackOverflow.

How to play it:

- Download the file x86.exe and run in in your Windows computer
- Have fun because for some reason I made it super hard! :D

Do you take gravity for granted?
